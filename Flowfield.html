<h1 id="visual-exploration">Visual exploration</h1>
<p><strong>Flowfield</strong> is a visual research project constructed with shaders in the VFX graph (Unity) as a way to explore to dynamic real-time graphics. The particles flow through a field that is changing according to a depth texture.</p>

<h1 id="adding-physics">Adding physics</h1>
<p>Over the course of several iterations, I started to implement variations with forces. In addition to the depth texture, there would be random wind forces that would affect the particles in a more natural way. Suddenly, I started thinking in terms of attraction and repulsion as a way to mold the outcome of the shaders.</p>

<h1 id="stamping">Stamping</h1>
<p>I quickly realized that you could create some cool stamping effects by controlling the intensity of particle attractions and the way they spawn according to the depth texture.</p>

<h1 id="smoothing-the-attraction">Smoothing the attraction</h1>
<p>I was always attracted to the idea of emerging patterns in the systems that we create. The idea that your artwork will, unknowingly to you, shift it&#39;s appearance over time by tweaking certain parameters and letting it do it&#39;s thing. This is a good example of a river-like pattern that emerged as I was reducing the attraction factor on the depth texture.</p>

<h1 id="adding-the-third-dimension">Adding the third dimension</h1>
<p>Up until this point, I was strictly working in 2D to simplify the prototyping process but I eventually ported the shaders to 3D and started to imagine the Flowfield in a 3D grid instead.</p>

<h1 id="color-and-flow">Color and Flow</h1>
<p>The visuals were pretty linear. So, I needed to improve and re-iterate on them by creating relationships between the depth texture, the density, the speed and color of the particles. This resulted in a nice looking flowfield that emulated the flow of fire in stylistic way!</p>
