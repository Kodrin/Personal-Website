My work has always been about bridging the gap between art and code. I have a solid background in graphics programming leveraging the DirectX API to develop real-time simulations and shaders for projects. I am also proficient in tools development, often leveraging code to create procedural assets or facilitate pipelines. This skillset has put me in a unique position to contribute as a technical artist as well by handling various shader-related, real-time VFX and procedural generation tasks (through code and Houdini). As such, I have a solid understanding of the 3D pipeline and am able to communicate easily with both artists and programmers.\n            </p>\n        </section>\n\n        <!--divider-->\n        <hr class=\"line\">\n\n        ".concat(common.Footer(), "\n    </div>\n    </body>\n    ");
