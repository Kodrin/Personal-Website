# Summary

Massless clouds is an interactive real-time installation showcased in the TeamLab Macau exhibition hall. It's a 3x3 grid shaped environment where we artificially simulated wind conditions with turbines which would affect the foam that was ejected through the ceiling. My contribution to this was developing the real-time graphics projection onto the clouds (from projectors in the ceiling) which would in turn get affected by the people within the room (with the help of depth sensors). This way people could interact with the foam and see the real-time projection change with their movement. The artistic intent was to immerse the participant in a sea of dynamically changing clouds.
