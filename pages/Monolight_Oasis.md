P{Monolight Oasis is a real-time audio reactive scene that was done during the Unity 2021 hackweek. The Unity Hackweek is an annual internal event where people group up for 1 week to produce a project inside of Unity. This work was only made possible in the timespan of 1 week because of the 8 other collaborators who all contributed to the final product. Credits and live demo can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/Ht3WWhx1bBU">HERE</a>. My main contribution to this project was developing the most of the real-time visual effects that you see on screen.}

P{A lot of the work on the 3D assets can be attributed to Camille Rail and Erik Polasek. The lighting was the work of Jean-Philippe Leroux. This oasis was insipired by the works of Kejyun Wu who also makes interactive 3D diaromas.}

P{The rocks were the result of the beautiful sculpting work done by Erik Polasek. He provided some of the rock variations that I used for the floating rocks VFX.}
