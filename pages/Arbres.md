<b>"Les arbres communiquent entre eux Ã  200hz"</b> is an exhibition piece directed by Artist Nelly-Eve Rajotte where I was commissioned as a visual effect artist.
The work is intented to be displayed on 3 4k projectors stiched together. Hence, the very wide aspect ratio of the renders. The work is a pre-rendered point cloud 
film meant to immerse the viewers in a forest that feels lively through things like color, camera, point movement and sound play. My contribution to this was sorting the point clouds, developing the visual projection elements (The final renders), coding the tools & shaders, and establish solid camera work along with an art direction that matched the 
data that I was given

Before using the point cloud that originally scanned, It had to undergo a rigurous process of sorting, reducing and segmenting the points into separate using open source software like Cloud Compare. This meant reducing a 1 billion point scan to several scans that were between 10-50 million points each. The work didn't stop there as the color data on the points had to go through extensive color correction measure with additional effects on them. You can see the treatment of the data down below with the first frame being the data with the original colors.
