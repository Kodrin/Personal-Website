P{Nirvana was a renewal project at the Odaiba exhibition in Tokyo which featured a pre-rendered mosaic on 8 vertical screens. For this, me and <a href="https://twitter.com/sakope">Sakota Yoshiaki</a> were tasked with transforming the work from pre-rendered animations to a real-time piece. My main contribution to this project was the creation of the real-time compositing and layering system. Sakota-san handled the flower simulations and interactions.}

P{Below is a breakdown of all the post-processing effects that were applied to the 3D models in real-time. The animals themselves along with the environment could only be rendered in screenspace on the flower grid. The compositing relied heavily on layer tagging certain parts of the models. I created a sky shader as a based for the background then applied an outline shader for the golden rims. I then create a cloud shader that would scroll along the canvas and then finished it off with a worn gold peeling effect at the end. }
