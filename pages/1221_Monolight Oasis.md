Monolight Oasis is a real-time audio reactive scene that was done during the Unity 2021 hackweek. The Unity Hackweek is an annual internal event where people group up for 1 week to produce a project inside of Unity. This work was only made possible in the timespan of 1 week because of the 8 other collaborators who all contributed to the final product. Credits and live demo can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/Ht3WWhx1bBU">HERE</a>. My main contribution to this project was developing the most of the real-time visual effects that you see on screen.

A lot of the work on the 3D assets can be attributed to Camille Rail and Erik Polasek. The lighting was the work of Jean-Philippe Leroux. This oasis was insipired by the works of Kejyun Wu who also makes interactive 3D diaromas.

The rocks were the result of the beautiful sculpting work done by Erik Polasek. He provided some of the rock variations that I used for the floating rocks VFX.
