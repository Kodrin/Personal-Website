P{The TeamLab firefly engine is a plugin I developed alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/EyezCG">Eyez Li</a> for the digital museum exhibition pieces. The plugin was meant to service the renewal of already existing projects. The firefly engine is built to run on compute shaders and is a self synchronizing with a fully interactive system for the users. This system is not strictly meant for fireflies and can be used for any agent system that requires synchronicity and swarm grouping. During development , we heavily leaned on the book "Sync" by Steven Strogatz to inform our synchronization models such as the kuramoto and clock nudging model.}
