The Houdini tooling project is a collection of some of the tools that I have made accross several different projects over the past year. The collection ranges from personal project tools to tools I have developed for my job.

# Snowy Terrain Generator

I had a lot of fun on this, I just wanted to make something where you drew smudges on a plane and it generated everything for you to make it look like a snowy mountain.

# Clay Vessel Generator

You just input a curve and it will handle all the characteristics of a clay vessel including asymmetry, clay ridges and cracks (not shown here).

# Bridge Tool

This also takes a simple curve as an input and it will generate a wooden bridge taking also into account what is underneath (such as terrain).

# Moss Generator

Very quick thing I did. This will take your input geometry and generate moss according to occlusion and sun direction. The moss itself is an L-system which can easily be replaced by quads for optimization.

# Vector Field Baker

One of the projects I worked on needed VFX particles to move a certain way and so I made a vector field baker where you could manipulate the path of the particles in a more precise way.

# Point Cloud Differential Tool

Another project needed some way to display the difference between a point cloud and a mesh (to show if anything had changed visually). I developed the first pass of the algorithm inside of Houdini and it will basically map out in a heatmap where the point cloud differs from its corresponding mesh.
