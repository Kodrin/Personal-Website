      <h1>For analog photographers</h1>
      <p>
        Lumograph is a web app, built on Node.js, to archive, sort and showcase film photos from indie analog photographers. Photographers first batch archive their photos to create a JSON registry of all the photos taken. This is done through Lumograph's archiving system which looks through the photo folders and sorts them through their name. The app follows a naming convention of ROLLNUMBER_ROLLTYPE_ISO to sort the photo (e.g 12_FUJI_100). The user then creates "Collections", which are curated albums of photos they want to showcase, by creating a folder locally with the photos in it. The changes are pushed online and the app automatically cross references the collection photos with the archive to display the photo information.

      <h1>Collection View</h1>
      <p>
        Navigating to a collection brings you to the collection view which displays the frame information for those particular exposures. The current format is "Exp.###" (the unique ID of that frame), Roll Type, ISO setting and the Roll it belongs to (specified by a roll number).

      <h1>Archiving</h1>
      <p>
        The archive section contains the record of all registered pictures with their metadata. It supports the recording of the exposure #, roll type, ISO, film size, location and the lab used to develop the film.
